# iRacing Slip Tool

This tool accesses driver data using the Python iRacing SDK and calculates the slip angle of the car. This is a useful measurement that can be used to make drivers faster through corners and help them realize when they are over or under driving. A user will then be able to determine what their ideal slip angle is in a given car for a given corner and try to replicate it as a training aid. Since racing simulators like iRacing lack a seat of the pants (SoP) feeling, additional data can be used to give the driver a better idea of what is going on with the car.
